1. Overview

The Pomodoro Tracker is a productivity web app that helps users manage their focus and break cycles using the Pomodoro technique.
It runs entirely in the browser, requires no backend, and stores user preferences in localStorage for persistence.

	•	Tailwind CSS for styling
	•	shadcn/ui for UI components
